## Usage

### Prerequisites

#### Ubuntu and ROS

The package has been tested on Ubuntu 20.04 and ROS noetic. The **default** Eigen is enough for this package to work normally.

#### MAVROS

Follow the guide in https://docs.px4.io/main/en/ros/mavros_installation#install-mavros.

#### Dynamic reconfigure

```bash
sudo apt install ros-noetic-ddynamic-reconfigure
```

#### PX4-Gazebo Simulation

First, clone the source code of PX4-Autopilot:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot.git --recursive
```
If the clone process completes without any errors, proceed directly to the next step. Otherwise, you can consider the following command:

```bash
cd PX4-Autopilot/
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

Then run the following script to setup:
```bash
bash Tools/setup/ubuntu.sh
```

Reboot, and
```bash
cd PX4-Autopilot/
make px4_sitl_default gazebo
```

You may need to wait a few seconds for gazebo to initialize. After initialization, type `commander takeoff` to make the drone take off, or type `commander land` to make it land.

To increase the frequency of odometry, you can modify the following code in `~/PX4-Autopilot/src/modules/mavlink/mavlink_main.cpp`:
```C++
configure_stream_local("LOCAL_POSITION_NED", 125.0f);  // originally 30.0f
configure_stream_local("ODOMETRY", 125.0f);  // originally 30.0f
```
and `make px4_sitl_default gazebo` again.

Add environment variables to the `.bashrc` file:
```bash
# >>> PX4 initialize >>>
source ~/PX4-Autopilot/Tools/simulation/gazebo-classic/setup_gazebo.bash ~/PX4-Autopilot ~/PX4-Autopilot/build/px4_sitl_default
export ROS_PACKAGE_PATH=$ROS_PACKAGE_PATH:~/PX4-Autopilot
export ROS_PACKAGE_PATH=$ROS_PACKAGE_PATH:~/PX4-Autopilot/Tools/simulation/gazebo-classic/sitl_gazebo-classic
# <<< PX4 initialize <<<
```

#### OSQP

The version of cmake on Ubuntu 20.04 is a bit old and cannot compile the latest version. Therefore, it is necessary to revert to a slightly older version.

```bash
git clone --recursive -b release-0.6.3 https://github.com/osqp/osqp.git
```

If the clone process completes without any errors, proceed directly to the next step. Otherwise, you can consider the following command:

```bash
cd osqp
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

Then, create a build directory:

```bash
cd osqp
mkdir build
cd build
```

Next, create the Makefiles and compile:
```bash
cmake -G "Unix Makefiles" ..
cmake --build .
```

Finally,
```bash
cmake --build . --target install
```
(May require administrator privileges)

Ensure that `libosqp.so` is present, then update the dynamic link library cache using the `ldconfig` command.

### Cloning the code and compiling

```bash
sudo apt install ros-noetic-ddynamic-reconfigure
cd catkin_ws/src
git clone https://github.com/OliverWu515/ommpc_controller.git
cd ..
catkin_make
```

### Run the code

```bash
source devel/setup.bash
roslaunch px4 mavros_posix_sitl.launch
roslaunch ommpc_controller px4_example.launch
```

Takeoff: First, type the following command in the terminal:
```
rosservice call /mavros/set_mode 0 "OFFBOARD"
```

Then, check the `takeoff_enabled` box in the rqt_reconfigure window. The drone will automatically arm and take off.

Command: Check the `command_or_hover` box in the rqt_reconfigure window. The drone will then execute the text trajectory or polynomial trajectory.

Landing: Check the `land_enabled` box in the rqt_reconfigure window. The drone will automatically land and attempt to disarm. If disarming is successful, you can type the following command in the terminal:
```
rosservice call /mavros/set_mode 0 "MANUAL"
```
to return to manual control mode, or you can proceed directly to execute other commands.

**Important:**

The pose of Odometry is defined as forward x, left y, upward z (ENU). The nose of the aircraft points in the positive x-axis direction, and the throttle thrust direction is along the positive z-axis. They must be strictly aligned. If the coordinate frame is NED instead of ENU, the `enu_frame_` parameter in the `OMMPC_EXAMPLE` class must be set to `false`! 

The definition of velocity in Odometry differs from the [ROS official documentation](http://docs.ros.org/en/noetic/api/nav_msgs/html/msg/Odometry.html). The ROS official definition expresses velocity in the body frame, but most open-source odometry systems define velocity relative to the world frame. This controller also defaults to defining velocity in the world frame. If the velocity you are using is defined in the body frame, set `vel_in_body_` to true in the `init` method of the `OMMPC_EXAMPLE` class (**for example, when using Gazebo for simulation**). Otherwise, set it to false (**for example, when using open-source odometry for realworld experiments**).

## Theory and parameters

### Reading text trajectories

If reading text trajectories for testing is enabled, after entering command control mode, the file stored at the path `ref_txt/ref_filename` will be read line by line with a fixed step size `ref_txt/time_step`. The format of each line is:
```
x-position y-position z-position x-velocity y-velocity z-velocity yaw yaw-rate
```
In the `traj` folder, several scripts are stored for generating text trajectories as needed.  
Note: The text trajectory must not contain empty lines at the end, otherwise a memory error may occur and lead to a crash!

**Related parameters**:  
ref_txt:   
&emsp; enable: Allows the use of text trajectories. If set to `false`, commands from the planner are received instead.  
&emsp; time_step: The sampling step size for the text trajectory. Special attention: The step size for MPC and the text reference trajectory must be consistent. This requires ensuring that **this parameter, `MPC_params/step_T` (the MPC step size), and the step in the script generating the text trajectory** are the same!  
&emsp; ref_filename: The path to the text trajectory file, specified as a **relative path** relative to this project.

### Theory and parameters

For the derivation with respect to the dynamic of quadrotors, refer to the file `OMMPC_derivation.pdf` in this repo.

For more general conclusions, refer to [G. Lu, W. Xu and F. Zhang, "On-Manifold Model Predictive Control for Trajectory Tracking on Robotic Systems," in IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics, vol. 70, no. 9, pp. 9192-9202, Sept. 2023](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9917382).

There are three ways to set the reference trajectory and control inputs:
- Set a hover reference. Related function: `setHoverReference`. This essentially sets the reference pose for the next several steps to the current pose and the velocity to 0.
- Set the reference from a text trajectory. Related functions: `setTextReference`, `get_txt_des`. This function will also be used while setting references during takeoff and landing.
- Set the reference from a polynomial trajectory. Related functions: `setTrajectoryReference`, `feed_from_traj_utils`. If it is necessary to read polynomial trajectories in other formats, you can implement them yourself.

We adopt Hopf fibration to calculate the full state from the flat outputs.

**Related parameters**:  
use_fix_yaw: Whether to fix the yaw angle   
use_trajectory_ending_pos: Whether to ensure reaching the trajectory endpoint, generally set to `true`  
MPC_params:  
&emsp; step_T: MPC step size. When using text trajectories, note that the text trajectory step size must be consistent with this.  
&emsp; Q_pos_xy, Q_pos_z: Weight for horizontal and vertical error, respectively. Should be set 1-3 orders of magnitude larger than other weights.  
&emsp; Q_attitude_rp, Q_attitude_yaw: Attitude error weight.  
&emsp; Q_velocity: Velocity error weight.  
&emsp; R_thrust: Thrust input penalty.  
&emsp; R_pitchroll, R_yaw: Angular velocity input penalty. These penalties should be relatively smaller, otherwise they affect control accuracy; but cannot be too small, otherwise the smoothness will be affected.  
&emsp; state_cost_exponential, input_cost_exponential: State/input error weight discount factor. The weight at step k is multiplied by exp{-k/total_steps * discount_factor}.  
&emsp; max_bodyrate_xy, max_bodyrate_z: Maximum angular rate. It is recommended to set the z-component relatively smaller.  
&emsp; min_thrust/max_thrust: Minimum/Maximum thrust (actually acceleration, unit: m/s^2)


### Thrust Normalization

Assume that

$$
t_{cmd}=\frac{a_{z,d}}{T_a}
$$

where $T_a$ is the normalization constant, which is determined by the physical characteristics of the quadrotor, and can be estimated by Kalman filtering

$$
\begin{aligned}
x_k&=T_{a,k} \\
z_k&=a_z=t_{cmd}\ T_{a,k}
\end{aligned}
$$

Then

$$
\begin{aligned}
\breve{P}_k&=1/\rho \\
K_k&=\frac{\breve{P}_k\cdot t_{cmd}}{t_{cmd} \breve{P}_k\cdot t_{cmd}+\rho} \\
\hat{T}_{a,k}&=\breve{T}_{a,k}+K_k(a_{z,imu}-t_{cmd} \breve{T}_{a,k}) \\
P_k&=(1-K_k\cdot t_{cmd})\cdot \breve{P}_k \\
\end{aligned}
$$
